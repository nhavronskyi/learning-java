Advanced Transaction Management and Caching in JPA/Hibernate:
**Key Topics:**

- **Transaction Management:**
- In-depth understanding of transaction handling in JPA/Hibernate.
- Advanced techniques (e.g., programmatic transaction management, Transaction Synchronization, Propagation, Isolation
  Levels).

    - **Caching:**
        - Cache levels: First-Level Cache (EntityManager), Second-Level Cache (L2 Cache), and Query Cache.
        - Configuration and optimization of caching, including cache strategies (read-only, transactional).
        - Hands-on examples for cache setup and demonstrating its impact on performance.

   **Key Topics:**
   - Advanced transaction management techniques (declarative and programmatic)
   - Propagation and isolation levels
   - Optimistic locking and versioning for data consistency
   - Second-level cache (L2 Cache) configuration and usage
   - Query caching and overall error handling within transactions

   **Practical Tasks:**

   	1. **Project and Database Setup:**  
   	   Set up a Spring Boot application with JPA/Hibernate and connect to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL). Verify basic CRUD operations using repositories.  
   	   *(Reference: “Java Persistence with Hibernate, 2nd Edition” – prerequisite chapters)*

   	2. **Declarative Transaction Management:**  
   	   Implement service methods using the `@Transactional` annotation to handle operations on multiple entities within one transaction.  

   	3. **Programmatic Transaction Management:**  
   	   Create an example where transactions are managed programmatically using TransactionTemplate or PlatformTransactionManager. Compare and discuss its advantages over declarative management.  

   	4. **Propagation and Isolation Levels:**  
   	   Develop methods with different propagation settings (e.g., REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW) and isolation levels (e.g., READ_COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE). Test the behavior when transactional conflicts occur.  

   	5. **Optimistic Locking and Versioning:**  
   	   Add a version field to an entity using `@Version` and create a scenario demonstrating concurrent updates and version conflict handling.  

   	6. **Configuring Second-Level Cache (L2 Cache):**  
   	   Configure an L2 Cache (for example, using Ehcache) in your Hibernate settings. Create a scenario where caching reduces the number of SQL queries during repeated CRUD operations.  

   	7. **Enabling Query Cache:**  
   	   Set up and enable the Query Cache in Hibernate, then write and execute queries to demonstrate the performance gains from caching repeated query results.  

   	8. **Error Handling in Transactions:**  
   	   Simulate an error during a transaction and verify that the transaction is properly rolled back. Ensure data consistency even when exceptions occur.  

   	9. **Testing with an In-Memory Database:**  
   	   Configure an in-memory database (e.g., H2) and write unit tests for your JPA repositories using Spring Boot Test and `@DataJpaTest` to verify transactional behavior and caching.
