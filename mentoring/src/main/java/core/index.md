## HOMEWORK

- [x] **Top-N Finder**: Find the top N elements in a collection dynamically.
- [x] **Dynamic Sorting Utility**: Create a utility that dynamically sorts a list of objects based on runtime-provided
  field names and directions.
- [x] **Dynamic Query Builder**: Implement a dynamic SQL query builder using Generics. The builder should accept
  criteria and return a query string while ensuring type safety for criteria values.
- [x] **Generic Retry Utility**: Create a generic retry utility that retries a failed operation. The utility should
  accept a lambda function and retry it based on a retry policy.
- [x] **Generic Validation with Dynamic Rules**: Create a utility to validate objects dynamically using rules provided
  at runtime. Each rule should be a `Predicate<T>` and applied sequentially.
- [x] **Frequency Sort**: Write a method that sorts a list of strings by their frequency (most frequent first).
