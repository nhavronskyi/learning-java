## 4 Weeks Intensive Java Bootcamp

### Rules

- _4 weeks intensive for learn technologies_
- _use AI to understand information_
    - _**don't use AI to write code for you**_
    - _**use AI tools for things I really know**_
- _Write a summary for each week (use readme for all those files)_
- _If you stack, ask for help_
- _Do not run to learn everything, just skip and return later (do not forget to note skipped info)_

### Take a look

- **Distributed Transactions:** Implementing consistency across multiple microservices using sagas or two-phase commit.
- **NoSQL Integration:** Building a microservice that works with non-relational databases.
- **Sharding and Replication:** Experimenting with scaling techniques for both relational and NoSQL databases.
- **(Optional) Distributed Caching:** Enhancing performance by integrating a caching layer.

Below is a list of recommended books that will help you gain the necessary theoretical background and practical
knowledge before tackling the assignments on advanced database work, transactions in microservices, NoSQL, and scaling:

1. **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann  
   This book provides an excellent overview of the fundamental principles of working with data, covering both relational
   and NoSQL stores, transactions, replication, and scaling. It is recommended for understanding the overall
   architecture of distributed systems.

2. **Java Persistence with Hibernate** by Christian Bauer, Gavin King, and Gary Gregory  
   A classic guide to Hibernate and JPA that covers the fundamentals of entity mapping, transactions, caching, and query
   optimization. This book is very helpful for working with relational databases and understanding ORM mechanisms.

3. **NoSQL Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence** by Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin
   Fowler  
   This book provides an overview of NoSQL database concepts, their differences from relational stores, and examples of
   usage in various scenarios. It serves as a good introduction to integrating NoSQL into a microservices architecture.
4. **Getting Started with Hazelcast - Second Edition**

These books will help you develop a deep understanding of the concepts behind modern approaches to data handling and
transactions, which in turn will make it easier to complete the practical assignments.
